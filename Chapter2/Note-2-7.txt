   * Section 2.7 Blockquote Element
  - It is a block element, it will be used when a quotation is too long to embed to it's surrounding text.
  - It's content spans the nonmargin part of enclosing container.
  - Browsers render the content with margin,but sometimes as an organization choice the browser may render the content of the element by displaying the text with italics.
  
     * Typical Defualt Display Properties
   W3C's HTML5 standard provides typical defualt displaying format for each element, browsers are not forced to display with format but they usually do.  
      Typical CSS code for displaying blockquote element:
         blockquote{
            display: block;
            margin-before: 1em;
            margin-after: 1em;
            margin-start: 40px;
            margin-end: 40px;
         }
         
      - cite Attribute
    The cite attribute is used to loacte the source for the quote we have embeded,
    - the value must be in URL form, browsers doesn't display the URL on the page becuause it's for developers not for end users.
    - useful for developers during maintaining the page and also used to validate if quote is still available on the source.  
    - we can also do using JavaScript code to use the URL's address and when the user hovers to the quote jump to the source for the quote.
     - Block Formatting
    When the blockquote element is enclosed with more than one line, you should use block formatting. 
    Block formatting is a coding-style convention where the start and end tags should be on thier own lines and the enlosed text is indented. 
     - Displaying a Web Page Without a Web Server
    - If we want the web page accessible to everyone we need to uplaod the .html files to the web server, but for quick test we open the web page on browser by just double clicking the file, this protocol known as file prtocol.
