   * Section 2.6 Block Elements
    - 
    - A Block element expands to fill the width of the container, so for a given container there will be only one block element for each row in the container. 
      -> phrasing element's width matches the width of the element's content
      -> multiple elements can display in one row
      -> the term "block-level element was part of HTML4 standard, but it's been omitted from the HTML5 standard. 
            -> it's probably because W3C feels HTML should focus on the content and CSS determine an element's formatting.
            -> but the term is not completely dead, mozilla still uses "block" to describe HTML concepts, and google use "block element" instead of "block-level element"
