  * Section 2.3 Commnets
  - Comments are human readable words but the computer skips, the need for using commnets is for making our code easy to understand and edit for other programmer, same approch goes if want to edit someone's code.
  - Browser engine is a software inside a web browser that's reads a web page's content eg.(HTML code, image files) and CSS, but here comments aren't read.
    eg. <!-- comment -->  for single line comment
        <!--
             comment      for multi line comment
        -->     
        
  - Documentation refers to a description of a program, this documentation can be in the form of a document completely separate from the source code or embedded in the source code itself.
  - comments are kind of embedded documentation and also the meta element another form of embedded documentation.
         always recommended to use meta author element.
