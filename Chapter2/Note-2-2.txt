  * Section 2.2 HTML Coding Conventions
  - Using improper code syntax, the browser won't display an errror insted try to render the code in a reasinable manner. but different brwosers might render it differently so web developers must try it with multiple browser and check it's syntax using W3C's HTML Validation service.
  - Coding-style convention: rules to the fomrat of the code. eg, there are some rules about when to use uppercase or lowercase or line break.
                             these conventions doesn't have any effect on the browser but the code become more easy and readable.
  - Companies need their programmers to writes codes as the standard coding convention: this helps companies to make easy things for debbuging and enhancing programs with large team.      
      -> some important style rules
    - for every container element always use both starting and ending tags.
    - always use lowercase for tag names and attribute names.
    - use lowercase for attribute values unless there's a reason for uppercase.
    - for attribute-value assignmetns,  surround the value with quotes and remove spaces between them.  
    - we use the capitalization rule for the doctype instruction: Google Style Guide uses uppercase
