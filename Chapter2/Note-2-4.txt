           eg. if we want to display a paragraph in our page, we should use the p element rather than other elements, so using the appropriate element will improve the accuracy of our page.

         -> enables the programmer to manipulate the web page more effectively using CSS and JavaScript
     - there's nothing in the HTML5 standard or W3C's HTML validation service that enforces this goal, it's left up to programmers' due diligence.
