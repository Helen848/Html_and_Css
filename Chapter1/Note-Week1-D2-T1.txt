  **Section 1.4 HTML Tags
 
   - To implement elements for a web page we need to use tags.
   - The use of tags is key characterstic of markup language which means it marks up the contents of an element with tags.
   - Hypertext is the html's ability to implement hyperlinks or (link) to able to jump to the other web page or within the same page.
   - so Generally speaking, HTML is the language that supports markup tags for formatting and the ability to jump to the other web pages.
   - Most of html tags comes with openig and closing tags.
   - There are two types of elements: container and void elements.
   
   eg.     <p>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</p>
         
         The above example shows us a container element with openig and closing tags.
  eg.     <meta charset="UTF-8">
         The above example shows us a void element has just one tag.
         
   **Section 1.5 Structural Elements 
   
   - Important html constructs: doctype, html head and body.
   - doctype construct is the instruction not an element and appears at the top of every web page. The html, head and body elements form basic structure of a web page, so we refer to structural elements.
   - The doctype instruction + structural elements for Skeleton Code.
       <!DOCTYPE html> -> tells the browser what type document the web page is.
       <html lang="en">  -> it's container it surrounds the rest of the web page.
       <head>
               -> it's a container, it includes elements that provides information about the web page as whole.
       </head>
       <body>
               -> it's also a contianer, it includes elements that display the content of the page.
       </body>
       </html
