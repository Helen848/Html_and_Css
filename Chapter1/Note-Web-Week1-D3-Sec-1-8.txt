  ***Section 1.8 HTML Attributes
  
  - Container elements provide information between their opening and closing tags, but void elements like meta element provide information using attribute.
  - Most attributes have a value assigned to them, although most have a value but there also attributes with themselves.
  - Most of the time we use attributesin void element but we can also use them inside the opening tag of the container element.
       eg. <body background="black"></body>
           <html lang="en"></html>  -> we use lang attribute to help search engines find web pages that uses particular language.
           
           
    * meta charset Element
  - meta charset element specifies the encoding scheme. which means when the web server transmits web page's source code to an end user doesn't encode the the binary representation, instead we use different encoding schemes.
     -> the reciever has to know the encoding scheme used by the sender. so meta charset element with the value "UTF-8" specifies the encoding scheme for web pages transmission.
     
    * meta name Element
  - common values used for meta name attribute are author, description and keywords.
      eg <meta name="author" content="Helen Mekonne">
      name and content attributes go together. The name attribute's value specifies the type of the content attribute's value specfies.
      
   - In addition meta description and meta keywords element help web search engines to find your web pages.  
    
    <meta name="description" content="Kansas City weather conditions"
    <meta name="keywords" content="KC, weather, meteorology, forecast" 
        -> meta description help to know the purpose of the web page
        The meta description and meta keywords elements are not more important as meta charset and meta name elements.
